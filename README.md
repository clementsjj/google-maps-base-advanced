### About

This is an upgraded version to the original google-maps-base.

While 'google-maps-base' is just a map that is loaded to the virtual dom,
'google-maps-base-advanced' takes Map as a React component, and renders react elements as information windows.

Basically everything is now more dynamic and should take care of any loading issues (by utilizing lazy loading).

There are also a few extra template items like a pop out side dialogue box with a few placeholders.
